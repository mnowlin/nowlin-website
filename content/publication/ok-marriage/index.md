### The Implementation of the Oklahoma Marriage Initiative to Individuals Receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

**Nowlin, Matthew C.** 2008. "The Implementation of the Oklahoma Marriage Initiative to Individuals Receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families."  _Oklahoma Politics_, Vol. 17: 111-131.

##### Abstract 
The Oklahoma Marriage Initiative (OMI) is the first large scale program in the country to promote marriage. One of the main audiences for marriage promotion is low-income families. This study provides the historical context and back- ground of how the OMI has been implemented. In particular, this study examines the implementation of the OM! to TANF recipients. This study provides the background of the OMI and raises some issues related to its implementation. These issues include how the goals of the program are defined, lack of caseworker reinforcement, and the need to address other issues related to poverty that impedes the development of healthy relationships.
