At the [College of Charleston](http://cofc.edu/), I have had the opportunity to teach courses at every level from freshman to a senior capstone course to graduate courses. Many of the courses I teach serve curriculum needs in several programs including political science, public administration, and environmental and sustainability studies. Regardless of the level, I try to guide students in becoming sophisticated users of information and engaged participants in social and political life.

See below for the most recent syllabi for the various courses I have taught.
