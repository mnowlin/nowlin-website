## Course Description

From the CofC catalog: 

> This course is intended to familiarize students with various ethical frameworks, analytical tools and policy instruments that can be used to evaluate environmental problems and policy options. Specific issues may include citizen participation, environmental equity, the uses and abuses of cost/benefit analysis, science and uncertainty in environmental policy development and the use of regulatory requirements vs. market mechanisms for environmental protection.

This course is an advanced undergraduate course.  We will examine the central dimensions of environmental politics and policy in the United States. Additionally, this course is a __sustainability-focused__ course associated with the college-wide focus on sustainability. For more information see here: [sustain.cofc.edu](http://sustain.cofc.edu/).  

The course will provide an overview of the development of environmental policy issues and environmental politics in the US. The first half of the course will provide an introduction to environmental policy and politics in the US and will provide a theoretical base for understanding environmental policy change and development; examine the fundamental beliefs and attitudes that have shaped environmental policies; the major political institutions in the U.S. that conceive, design, implement, and revise environmental policies; the role of science in environmental policy; and the application of economic principles to environmental issues. The second part of the course will use insights gained in the first part of the course to examine several environmental issues including air pollution, water pollution, land management, energy, and environmental justice.
