The College of Charleston newspaper, the [College Today](https://today.cofc.edu/), recently did a story on Lee Bundrick, an alum of the concurrent Masters in Public Administration and M.S. in Environmental and Sustainability Studies program. I had the pleasure to work with Lee as his research advisor  and I'm sure he will do great things in Kiawah and beyond. Lee was also awarded outstanding concurrent graduate student. 

See the full [article](https://today.cofc.edu/2019/05/09/public-administration-environmental-studies-lee-bundrick/). Great job, Lee!
