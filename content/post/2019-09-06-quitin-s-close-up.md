I recently had the distinct honor of being [interviewed](https://www.holycitysinner.com/2019/08/09/quintins-close-up-dr-matthew-nowlin/) by Quintin Washington, on Quintin's Close Ups about my [book](https://www.matthewcnowlin.com/post/environmental-policymaking-book/). Quintin is a [Charleston treasure](https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/the-scoop-on-one-of-the-holy-citys-most-prolific-video-journalists/Content?oid=6095263) and I really enjoyed our conservation. The YouTube video of the interview is below.
